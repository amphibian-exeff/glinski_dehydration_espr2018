rehydration_rates2.csv
spp: the common name for the amphibian that was used in that experiment
time: is the number of hours the amphibian was dehydrated for, prior to the amphibian being exposed for 8 hours
units:  grams per hour for the rehydration rate
pesticide: active ingredient that the amphibian were exposed to for 8 hours
rate: average rehydration rate in grams per hour for each amphibian
